# WindMill


How many time did you have the need to connect to a customer server but the customer didn't want to open the SSH server?

WindMill is a platform for remote support which simplify accessing remote machines behind NAT or restrictive firewalls.

Characters:

- WindMill: a bastion host which bridges connections from customers and operators
- Don: the client which connects to WindMill
- Sancho: a CLI for the operators to ease remote access
- Ronzinante: the server which does the dirty job on WindMill
